        <p class="text-gray-600">As an aspiring Agricultural Scholar at Bundelkhand University (2022-2026), my academic journey is enriched with hands-on experience from a recent internship at the Indian Chamber of Food and Agriculture. There, I focused on agricultural subsidies and applied research skills, deepening my understanding of policy impacts on farming communities.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">Serving as a Campus Ambassador for Pregrad honed my competencies in sales and communication, equipping me with the ability to advocate effectively for educational initiatives. I am committed to leveraging these experiences to foster advancements in sustainable agriculture practices. I have a particular interest in Logistics and Supply Chain Management.</p>
